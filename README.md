# Ergodic reinforcement learning

This repository contains an algorithm for transforming time-series data into time-series with ergodic increments. As an example application, it contains an implementation of a game with non-ergodic dynamics and a demo where reinforcement learning agents try to learn optimal policies for this game with transformed and untransformed reward time-series. A more detailed description of the method can be found in
